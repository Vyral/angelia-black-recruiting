There are certain deciding factors when it comes to your home’s value. Today we’ll discuss seven of them:

**1\. Neighborhood comparables.** In their assessment of your home’s value, an appraiser will rely on comparable prices of homes in your neighborhood. If a home down the street sold for x amount of money a year ago, don’t expect that to be factored into the appraisal; your appraiser will look at the most recent comps available.&nbsp;

**2\. Location.** The local school district, employment opportunities, entertainment or recreational amenities, etc., all figure into the viability of your home’s location and, therefore, its value.&nbsp;

**3\. Size and usable space.** Whether or not your home has a garage, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms it has, and the size of your family room are all examples of the usability of your home’s space.

**4\. Age and condition.** The age of your home and some of its major features like the roof and HVAC unit all play a part in your home’s value. Well-kept homes with newer appliances are sure to pull a little more money.&nbsp;

**5\. Upgrades.** A surefire way to get your home sold and for a handsome profit is by doing kitchen and bathroom renovations. Are these rooms in your home updated for today’s market?&nbsp;

**6\. Interest rates.** When rates are down, buyers have greater affordability to purchase a home, which makes a world of difference in your home’s value.&nbsp;

**7\. Market conditions.** Chief among all of these factors is the way the market is behaving and whether we’re in a seller’s market or a buyer’s market. The seller’s market we’re in right now puts sellers in the driver’s seat; the multiple-offer situations we’re seeing continues to drive home prices upward. &nbsp;
