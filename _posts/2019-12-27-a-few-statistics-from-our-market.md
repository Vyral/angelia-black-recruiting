I’ve spent a lot of time in recent months answering questions from springtime home sellers wanting to know what their home will sell for, and during that time I’ve come across some interesting market stats I want to quickly share with you today. In one of those months, for example, there were over 3,600 closings in the Charlotte area. The average sale price for those homes was $306,000, and their average days on market was 42 days. If you want to know what these stats are in your area, give me a call and I’d be happy to fill you in. To see my full message, watch this short video.
