How do you know the right time to switch from being a part-time agent to a full-time one? There are a few things to consider.&nbsp;

First, **know what your monthly expenses are.** What do you have to be able to produce in order to sustain your household costs?

Second, **think about your income goals.** Whenever you hit your target as a part-time agent, that’s the time to make real estate your career. Real estate is a tough career, and you’ll need some money in reserve to get started. You’ll also have to dedicate as much as 60 hours a week to it. Whatever your income goal is as a part-time agent, though, you’ll double as a full-time agent.&nbsp;

It’s also important to have the support of your family and friends. Working a 9-to-5 job and then taking an extra two hours afterward to do real estate prospecting and networking is a lot of time away from your family, so make sure they understand that you’re making real estate your full-time job as soon as you hit your goals.&nbsp;

Lastly, **create a daily schedule.** I have to know what I’ll be doing every day so I’m planned and focused. If I’m planned and focused, I’ll meet my goals.&nbsp;

Making the switch from part-time to full-time is definitely doable—I got my start as an agent while I was still working at Bank of America. Moving forward, I wish you luck in advancing your career.
