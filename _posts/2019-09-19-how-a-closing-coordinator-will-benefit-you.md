*Should I hire a closing coordinator?*

A fellow agent recently asked me this same question. She’d closed four deals in a month and was nervous because she didn’t have anything in her pipeline. She worked so hard during the contract-to-close phase for each deal that she didn’t have time to do any lead generation.&nbsp;

If you have the same problem, I’ll tell you exactly what I told her: **A closing coordinator will give you the leverage you need to work on lead generation.** Juggling multiple deals a month and working hard during the contract-to-close phase can be a full-time job. If you’re &nbsp;unable to keep up with your lead generation on top of these other tasks, you should hire a closing coordinator.&nbsp;

Another reason to hire a closing coordinator is to **help take care of the finer details of the transaction.** A closing coordinator is, ideally, a detail-oriented person who will make sure all documents are in order and keep your office in compliance. They’re a true behind-the-scenes admin. So if you’re not a detail-oriented person, why not alleviate that stress and hire a closing coordinator?

Where do you find a closing coordinator? There are plenty in our area who work as independent contractors who will work for you per closing. Be sure to ask if they’re licensed first, find out what they charge, and ask if they negotiate due diligence requests. Knowing these factors will help you determine which one is best for you to work with.

By the way, the agent I talked to did end up hiring a listing coordinator—a great one.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this or any other topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
