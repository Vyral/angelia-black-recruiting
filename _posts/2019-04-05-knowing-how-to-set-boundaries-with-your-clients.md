Agents come to me on a regular basis searching for answers on how they can stop working 24/7. This can be traced to the fact that **they haven’t set proper boundaries with their clients,** which is a must in your work life.&nbsp;

**Enforcing boundaries allows for a healthy work-life balance and bolsters your ability to serve your clients and generate leads in a maximally effective way.**&nbsp;

When we work with a client, we want them to know that our relationship is founded on care, trust, and our commitment to helping them. &nbsp;

How can we accomplish that while still setting up and maintaining boundaries?&nbsp;

During a buyer consultation, for example, you’ll want to ask a series of questions to determine what your client’s preferred method of communication is. **In this order, here are the questions to ask:&nbsp;**

What method is the best way to get ahold of you—by call, text, or email?&nbsp;<br>What time do you arrive at work each day?&nbsp;<br>When is your workday officially over?&nbsp;

By then sharing your hours of operation, you’re, in effect, setting the boundaries for the relationship with regard to communication and time.&nbsp;

Keeping those newly set boundaries in mind, let’s say your client is out hunting for homes, and they find a house they want to see. They’re so excited that they send you a text at 9:30 p.m. the next night. You’re unsure of what to do.&nbsp;

The truth of the matter is if you don’t respect the boundaries you’ve set, no one else will either. In this instance, I encourage you to wait until the next morning before returning a text. **This way, you’ll stem that feeling of exhaustion, and you’ll run your business—rather than having your business run you.&nbsp;**
