Many agents approach me to ask whether buying internet leads is a good idea, and the truth is that it depends. **There are two main factors you need to consider before you start buying leads online:**

1. Can you afford it?
2. Do you have systems in place to handle the new leads you get?

With these two points in mind, let’s dive a little deeper. Regarding the second factor, in particular, there are three main pieces of information you’ll need to know when handling leads: You need to know when you’ll respond, how you’re going to respond, and how you’re going to follow up after your initial attempts at contact.

Ideally, you should respond to each lead within five minutes. **The earlier you respond, the better chance you’ll have at converting that lead.** As for the way you respond (whether by phone, email, or text), it’s largely up to you. Personally, I believe one of the most effective methods is to reply back via text with a video of yourself thanking them for reaching out.&nbsp;

Of course, your first attempt at contacting a lead won’t always be successful. It often takes as many as 10 times to reach an internet lead. If at first you don’t succeed, keep reaching out. **I recommend attempting to get in touch a total of 10 times within a 12- to 15-day period after you first hear from them.** If everything goes as planned, this should help you connect with your next client.&nbsp;

So should you buy an internet lead? If you’re willing to follow the steps I’ve outlined today, then yes—you absolutely should.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
