I get asked all the time what buyers need to do to prepare for their home purchase. **Here are my top tips:**

**1\. Know your credit score.** Your score will affect the type of loan program you get.

**2\. Don’t open up new lines of credit.** While you’re out an about looking for a home, do not open any new credit cards, buy a car, furniture, or anything else with credit. These purchases will affect your score and what you can qualify for in a home. Wait until you’ve already bought the home to make those purchases.

**3\. Keep tabs on interest rates.** A lower rate means a lower payment and if you see rates starting to creep up, you need to take advantage and lock in something lower.

**4\. Work with a reputable lender.** If you need a mortgage, make sure you get pre-approved by a local, trusted lender. This will make your offer much stronger when you go to buy a home and make the closing process much simpler.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
