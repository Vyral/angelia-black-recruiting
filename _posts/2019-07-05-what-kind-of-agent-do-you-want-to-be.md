When it comes to determining if you want to be a buyer’s agent, a listing agent, or both, **I recommend that you take the DiSC Profile Test, which allows you to see what would best suit you according to your traits.** DiSC, of course, is an acronym that stands for “Dominant, Influential, Compliant, and Steady.”

**If you’re leaning more towards being a buyer’s agent, you would need to score high in the “i” category.** A great buyer’s agent is someone who is influential, social, and who likes to build relationships. They’ll need to be enthusiastic about going out to view homes, be able to talk people through the pros and cons of each listing, and really want to find the right home for their buyers.

On the other hand, **if you’re thinking more about becoming a listing agent, you’ll want to score high in the “D” category.** A good listing agent is dominant, direct, action-oriented, and really knows how to get the job done. I also believe that good listing agents are experienced in the real estate industry and have a good understanding of how to market your property. They’re not afraid to take no for an answer, they’ll keep pushing to get their sellers the best deal, and they understand the intricacies of listing a home.&nbsp;

But what if you want to do both? Well, you can certainly do both if you like, but **if you’re a natural “D” or “i,” you will likely feel more comfortable specializing in the respective role.**

If you take the DiSC profile test and have any questions or would like to continue this discussion with me, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help guide you in the right direction.
